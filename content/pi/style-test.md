# Murder in the Gunroom

<tt>TO _Colonel Henry W. Shoemaker_ an old and valued friend, who was promised
this dedication, with an entirely different novel in mind, twenty-two years
ago. </tt>

## PREFACE

_The Lane Fleming collection of early pistols and revolvers was one of the
best in the country. When Fleming was found dead on the floor of his locked
gunroom, a Confederate-made Colt-type percussion .36 revolver in his hand, the
coroner's verdict was "death by accident." But Gladys Fleming had her doubts.
Enough at any rate to engage Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand--better known just
as Jeff--private detective and a pistol-collector himself, to catalogue,
appraise, and negotiate the sale of her late husband's collection._

_There were a number of people who had wanted the collection. The question
was: had anyone wanted it badly enough to kill Fleming? And if so, how had he
done it? Here is a mystery, told against the fascinating background of old
guns and gun-collecting, which is rapid-fire without being hysterical,
exciting without losing its contact with reason, and which introduces a
personable and intelligent new private detective. It is a story that will keep
your nerves on a hair trigger even if you don't know the difference between a
cased pair of Paterson .34's and a Texas .40 with a ramming-lever._

## CHAPTER 1

It was hard to judge Jeff Rand's age from his appearance; he was certainly
over thirty and considerably under fifty. He looked hard and fit, like a man
who could be a serviceable friend or a particularly unpleasant enemy. Women
instinctively suspected that he would make a most satisfying lover. One might
have taken him for a successful lawyer (he had studied law, years ago), or a
military officer in mufti (he still had a Reserve colonelcy, and used the
title occasionally, to impress people who he thought needed impressing), or a
prosperous businessman, as he usually thought of himself. Most of all, he
looked like King Charles II of England anachronistically clad in a Brooks
Brothers suit.

At the moment, he was looking rather like King Charles II being bothered by
one of his mistresses who wanted a peerage for her husband.

"But, Mrs. Fleming," he was expostulating. "There surely must be somebody
else.... After all, you'll have to admit that this isn't the sort of work this
agency handles."

The would-be client released a series of smoke-rings and watched them float up
toward the air-outlet at the office ceiling. It spoke well for Rand's ability
to subordinate esthetic to business considerations that he was trying to give
her a courteous and humane brush-off. She made even the Petty and Varga girls
seem credible. Her color-scheme was blue and gold; blue eyes, and a blue
tailored outfit that would have looked severe on a less curvate figure, and a
charmingly absurd little blue hat perched on a mass of golden hair. If Rand
had been Charles II, she could have walked out of there with a duchess's
coronet, and Nell Gwyn would have been back selling oranges.
