The preferred way of using images is placing them in the `assets/` directory
and referencing them with a relative path.

Standard image with no width modifier classes applied.

**HTML:**

```html
<img src="assets/filename.jpg" alt="" />
```

**or Markdown:**

```markdown
![alt](assets/filename.jpg)
```
