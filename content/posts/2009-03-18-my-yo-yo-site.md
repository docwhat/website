My site has bee having all kinds of fun the past week and a half.

Starting last Monday night the network was down for 4 and half days. This was
eventually resolved by Speakeasy.

<!-- more -->

It went down again yesterday.

Today I tortured the site to fix
[a bug](http://code.google.com/p/diso/issues/detail?id=101). The ever
excellent [Will Norris](http://willnorris.com/) took a dive through the code
to figure out that my apache rewrite rules for
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/)' permalinks were incorrect.

How embarrasing.

I'm not sure how that happened since it used to work. :-/

_sigh_
