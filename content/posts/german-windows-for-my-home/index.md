I'm looking to replace the windows in my home. I'm fond of the German style
windows, known in the U.S.A. as tilt-turn windows.

I've found a couple places that look decent, and wanted to record them here
for future use. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, I'd appreciate
it. I'm also looking for someone to install them (and remove the existing
ones) in the Pittsburgh, PA area.

I'm probably looking to add a ductless AC system (my house is old with no
central air) at the same time, since I don't want to put in nice windows and
re-install my window-mounted AC units (assuming I could make them work in
tilt-turn windows).
