If you haven\'t heard of [MacHeist](http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/314119/),
then you should go check it out right now.  It\'s only good for four more
days. What they do is sell a bundle for \\\$39 that includes lots of different
mac software from different vendors.

They exact amount of software you'll get depends on how many people sign up.
 As each milestone is met, another package is unlocked. 25% of the \$39 goes
to one of their 10 charities (or split between all 10), your choice.

<!-- more -->

They also have other little \"missions\" and side things to get more software.
Right now, for example, they have a
[tweetblast](http://www.macheist.com/tweetblast) that\'ll get you
[Delicious Library 2](http://delicious-monster.com/) and really fun game,
[Multiwinia](http://www.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/).

So [go](http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/314119/) and donate to charity and
have a blast playing with all the software. ;-)

Ciao!
