I had this idea of this _huge_ post I'd write about how I went about getting a
house and the paperwork and all that stuff.

Well, it turns out I really don't want to write that. Instead, I'm going to
write about one of the people that I can really recommend; Cathy Ferguson our
"mortgage advisor." I think mortgage advisor is a fancy word for mortgage
broker. Not sure, though.

We wanted to know about our mortgage options before we started looking at
houses. We knew what we wanted in most ways, just not in money
terms.<!-- more -->

First off, we tried going to our local bank. The guy we talked to was very ...
unprofessional. It's not that we wanted a guy dressed in an impeccable suit,
etc. I mean, I wore flip flops and shorts. But he had stains. He tried working
through numbers on a pad of paper (the computer was down or something). He
gave us numbers in an estimate that didn't jib with what we talked about and
it was missing details. It had incorrect numbers in it, after we had given him
the correct numbers.

Altogether, we weren't impressed.

When we talked to Chaim Davidson at the
[Sq. Hill Avalar](http://chaimdavidson.com/) realtors he strongly recommended
Cathy as someone he'd works with a lot. We weren't sure which realtor we would
deal with at that point, but we decided to try Cathy.

We met with her and she went through all the different ways she recommended
doing a loan for us. She explain the pros and cons really well. And we left
feeling that we understood what we were getting into; as well we felt that if
our notes (she helped us with them) weren't enough then we could ask her at
any time for help.

As we got closer to actually buying a house she was a great help. She kept in
touch without overwhelming us. I have a ton of emails from her; not to mention
phone calls. If I panicked about something, I could call her on the phone and
she would help me out.

She was easy to talk to, relaxed yet very professional. She had that sort of
"geek" concentration that computer programmers get when they work on things.
She was able to deal with the fact we were a strange couple (i.e. we could do
math, had done research before-hand, had weird ideas about what we wanted,
etc.)

She got us a great deal and she kept us abreast of how the market was. We
closed our loan right as loans were starting to dry up due to the sub-prime
loan collapse. Our loan was just a normal fixed rate loan, but all loans were
being effected. She followed the market right up till two weeks before closing
to try to get the best deal.

I cannot recommend her enough.

Ciao!
