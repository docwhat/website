This is a bit of code I wanted to save.

When using HEREDOCs in Ruby, the `<<-` operator is handy to keep everything
indented in the source. But it doesn't help with the content of the HEREDOC.

Example:

```ruby
def example
  puts <<-EOF
This is left.

  This is indented two.
  EOF
end
```

In rails, you can do this:

```ruby
def example
  puts <<-EOF.strip_heredoc
    This is left.

      This is indented two.
  EOF
end
```

There's a helpful
[Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3772864/how-do-i-remove-leading-whitespace-chars-from-ruby-heredoc)
on this, in fact.

Here's a simplish solution for plain 'ol Ruby:

```ruby
def unindent(string)
  first = string[/As*/]
  string.gsub(/^#{Regexp.quote first}/, '')
end

def example
  puts unindent(<<-EOF)
    This is flush left.

      This is indented by two spaces
  EOF
end
```

Too bad you can't pull in some of these Rails monkey patches without pulling
in lots of stuff you don't want.
