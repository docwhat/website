I have just finished Firefox 3.6 after working like crazy since FF 3.6 came
out.

<!-- more -->

It only works in FF3.6, but the statistics show that the users of It's All
Text! upgrade their browser almost immediately after a new version comes out,
so I'm not worried.

It's approved and available via the
[normal spot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125).

I apologize for not getting this done before FF 3.6. I don't have a real
excuse except being lazy and busy with other things. But I have to say the
amount of emails I got asking for a FF 3.6 version definitely got me off my
butt. :wink:

Ciao!
