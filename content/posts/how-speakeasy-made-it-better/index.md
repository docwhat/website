As I [mentioned before](/how-to-make-a-customer-want-to-leave/) , I have been
having trouble with Speakeasy. I had already researched other competitors and
was contemplating changing to someone else. I would have missed the technical
competency of Speakeasy support but I could live with the people who follow
scripts.

Fortunately, I was called by Prince (name changed to protect the innocent); a
manager for Speakeasy. He fixed everything; he waived all costs (about \$300)
which includes the modem. He agreed that paying for sub-par service wasn't
reasonable. After all, I could have stayed with [Verizon](/verizon-sucks/) for
that (zing!).

He said that SpaceGhost never contacted him or filed a ticket for the manager
to talk to me. Apparently something in the ticket alerted him. I suspect it
was that the ticket was open for 2 weeks.

So I am a happy person.

I have abandoned my
[EECB](https://consumerist.com/2007/05/11/how-to-launch-an-executive-email-carpet-bomb/ 'Executive Email Carpet Bomb')
planning and have returned to DEFCON 5. It would have been a real pain if I
had to switch vendors.

Ciao!
