On my OS X systems, [Vim](https://www.vim.org) and
[MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) has been crashing a lot. The
main symptom is that anything using
[Omni completion](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Omni_completion), such as
[NeoComplCache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache), would try to use the
built in Ruby and cause vim to die with `Vim: Caught deadly signal SEGV`.

It turns out that this is due to vim loading ruby modules/libraries not
compatible with the system Ruby.

I have [RVM](https://rvm.io/) installed on my system and what was happening is
that:

-   RVM sets the `GEM_PATH` and `GEM_HOME`.
-   I had a version of Ruby 1.8.7 in RVM. This is the same version as (Mac)Vim
    and OS X has installed in `/usr/`.
-   I had binary (compiled) gems installed for the RVM 1.8.7 Ruby. These are
    files that end in `.so`.
-   So (Mac)Vim tries to do completion, tries loading a binary gem from the
    `GEM_PATH`, finds the RVM 1.8.7 version of the `.so` gem module, loads it,
    and crashes.

This isn't surprising. My RVM doesn't compile Ruby the same way Apple does.
This is deliberate, because I want certain performance behaviors, etc.

Anyway, the solution is simple enough.

If you got your Vim and MacVim through [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) (and
really, you should), then just add this to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
for i in /usr/local/opt/vim/bin/*(N) /usr/local/opt/macvim/bin/*(N); do
  i=$(basename $i)
  alias "${i}"="env -u GEM_PATH -u GEM_HOME command ${i}"
done
```

Homebrew installs a symlink for most kegs into
`/usr/local/opt/*package-name*`, which makes it simple to find the list of all
binaries in a keg. The `(N)` is a ZSH-ism that says it is okay for the `*` to
return nothing. If you're using bash, just remove the `(N)`

The upshot is that this unsets the `GEM_PATH` and `GEM_HOME`.

You may also want your `EDITOR` environment variable to include the
`zshâ€ºenv -u GEM_PATH -u GEM_HOME` part as well:

```zsh
export GIT_EDITOR="env -u GEM_PATH -u GEM_HOME vim +1"
export EDITOR="env -u GEM_PATH -u GEM_HOME vim"
```

Ciao!
