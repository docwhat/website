Microsoft has finally figured out how to make opening a `.txt` file
dangerous...

> "This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in
> Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a
> user opens a legitimate rich text format file (`.rtf`), **text file
> (`.txt`)**, or Word document (`.doc`) that is located in the same network
> directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (`DLL`) file."

Emphasis is mine.
