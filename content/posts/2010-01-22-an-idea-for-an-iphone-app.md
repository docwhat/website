Robin (my awesome wife) came up with an idea for an iPhone app.

We were watching [UHF](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/) and there is a
bit where a guy is trying to
[teach poodles to fly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kFGxH4wrs4)... by
throwing them out the 3rd floor window. There was a pile poodles on the lawn
of his apartment building.

She cracked up.

After she recovered and picked herself off the floor, she said that I should
make a "Teach Poodles to Fly" app. I haven't written an iPhone app yet, but
you know...it almost sounds like fun.

You would use the flick motion to launch poodles out a window. If you miss,
the poodle hits the wall instead of going out the window. Of course, it's
probably not a happy thing for the poodle, either way.

Ciao!
