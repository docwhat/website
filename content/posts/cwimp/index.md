![CWimp for the Palm](screenshot.gif 'Screenshot of CWimp in action')

Way back when, I wrote a version of
[Cosmic Wimpout](http://cosmicwimpout.com/) for the palm.

The page that had the links to the sources, the bug tracker, etc. have been
slowly decaying. Since I have moved to a [new webpage](/moving-to-a-blog/) I
decided to move Cosmic Wimpout over to ~~[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/)~~.

Link: [CWimp on GitHub](https://github.com/docwhat/cwimp)

Maybe someone will want to work on it. Or maybe I'll buy a new palm one of
these days. I heard rumors that Palm runs Linux or something like that.

Ciao!

**UPDATE 2011-03:** I have moved it to GitHub instead of hosting it locally.
This project is really dead, but if it still works for you, great!
