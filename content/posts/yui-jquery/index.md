I just switched my (rather limited) JavaScript from
[YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui) to [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

jQuery took a little (a couple hours) to learn how to write something close to
idiomatic code. My new code is much smaller and easier to read.

<!-- more -->

Why did I switch away from YUI you might ask?

A couple reasons:

1.  jQuery has a bunch of idiomatic constructs to make what I'm doing here
    much easier: Example:

```javascript
$('table tbody tr:even').each(function () {
    $(this).addClass('alt')
})
```

2.  jQuery is smaller.
3.  I use YUI at work.
4.  I just wanted to try something new.

Ciao!
