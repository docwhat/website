I opened the door this morning and found Mr. Cicada hanging out on the screen
door. He was very patient and waited for me to get my camera out and let me
take several photos.

Getting the flash right was a pain, but I had a white handkerchief in my
pocket that I eventually got folded right so that he wasn't all washed out by
the flash.

I used to see these suckers all the time when I grew up in Delaware. But I
haven't seen many here in Pittsburgh. Occasionally I find the shells, though.
