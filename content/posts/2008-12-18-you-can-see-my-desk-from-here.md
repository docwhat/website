Pop City did an article about my workplace and
[you can see my desk](# 'Broken Link') in the photo.

BTW: This blog is unrelated to my workplace; none of my comments here should
be construed to reflect opinion of my past, present or future employers.
Though it is a cool place to work with [many](# Peter Pawlowski)
[cool](# 'Andrew Cox') [people](http://ekilon.livejournal.com/).
