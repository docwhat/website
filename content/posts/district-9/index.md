I saw District 9 last night and it was spectacular. I'm not sure what I can
say about it without ruining the movie. Let me think... uh. Its sci-fi, but
mainly a human drama. It has comedy and action, but it is ultimately a story
about humans being inhuman and humane.

<!-- more -->

The special effects and visuals are flawless. So much so that you forget they
are even there as you become immersed in the story.

But the story is the best and main part.

I recommend you go see it. Soon. Before everyone on the internet blabs about
it.

Ciao!
