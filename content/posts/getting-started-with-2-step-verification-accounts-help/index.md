If you use any Google services (GMail, GTalk, etc.) and you care even a little
bit about the data in that account, then you should turn on
[2-step](http://bit.ly/w81zSc) verification.

If you need a story to explain why you need this, the check out this story by
James Follow as he recounts
[how his wife's account was hacked](http://bit.ly/zC1LdH) (This is an article
from _The Atlantic_).

It's almost like a modern day camp-fire ghost story; it sent shivers up and
down my spine.

I regularly backup my GMail account (and copies of my calendar and contacts
are stored on my computer, phone, etc.) but having someone going through my
emails wouldn't make me happy.

So go and enable 2-step verification. It's not perfect but it will lower the
odds of you having your own horror story to tell.

Ciao!
