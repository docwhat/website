Read this book!

For those unfamiliar with
[Scott Adams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/) and his comic
strip, [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com/), this rant won't be interesting. The
only thing you should take away from this is that evolution is _not_ bullshit
and that you should read
[The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0199291152%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0199291152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02)
by [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/home).

Scott Adams, it turns out, is pretty darn smart. He reads stuff. He thinks
about stuff. However, it doesn't mean he isn't wrong. He wrote a rant
"[Fossils are bullshit](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/03/fossils_are_bul.html)"
on his [Dilbert Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/) where
he reads a Newsweek article on msnbc and then declares that his bullshit
detector thinks evolution and the fossil record is bullshit.

Let's first off give Mr. Adams credit for even thinking about this. A bunch of
people in the word just read Newsweek and don't really think about what it
says or talk about it anything. Kudos. It's good to think.

It should also be mentioned that the Newsweek article is full of "evolution
revolution" claptrap. How that didn't set his bullshit detector off, I don't
know. If there was a revolution, it'd be a big deal and in more than just one
article in Newsweek and it'd not be obvious it was a revolution until after it
had hit at least a few other sources.

Back to Mr. Adams: It is possible that one person might know more than many
scientists who study a specific thing. It happens every so often, but it isn't
likely and it is the responsibility of the person making the claims to provide
some proof. If Mr. Adams has some proof to back up his claims that evolution
is bullshit, then he should definitely provide some proof. But I suspect the
real problem is that he doesn't understand what evolution claims.

More can be said on this, but
[PZ Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers), an evolutionary
developmental biologist and rather famous skeptic, does a better job than I
could in his blog post
"[Scott Adams reads Newsweek. Uh-oh.](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/17/scott-adams-reads-newsweek-uho/)".

The most important thing though is this: read
[The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0199291152%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0199291152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02)
by [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/home). It is an exciting read.
It is written clearly. And you'll like it, I promise! It explains what
evolution really is. The stuff you learned in high school (if you remember it)
probably didn't explain it well enough. This will. You will come away looking
at the world going, "Gosh! This is amazing!" … and it is!

Seriously. Read it.

Ciao!
