Robin and I both got Google phones while in New York over the holidays.  She
bought a [G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/) and I ordered the
[ADP1](http://code.google.com/android/dev-devices.html).

I've been working my way through
"[Hello, Android](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/eband/hello-android)" by Ed
Burnette.  So far it's been decent.  You can get
[30% off (till 2009/1/31)](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=704) using a
special code.  I bought the PDF and paper book for less than Barnes and Nobels
is selling it down the street.  Good deal, I think.

The hardest part is that so much is alien.  I only ever coded for the Palm
(version 2 and 3).  The life cycle is no problem; it makes perfect sense.  But
things like Java and Eclipse...well, I've never used them before.

Ciao!
