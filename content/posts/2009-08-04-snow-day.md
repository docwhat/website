The season is all wrong for this but the song still rocks.

Emma, 8 years old, apparently wrote this song and performs it wonderfully.

From her guitar teacher, [Rob](http://www.heartwoodguitar.com/WordPressBlog/):

> Emma announced during a guitar lesson one day that she felt like writing a
> song. I started playing some chords, and this is what she came up with.
> Amazing. [The Jam](http://www.heartwoodguitar.com/2009springcsjvids.htm)'s a
> chance for Heartwood Guitar Instruction students to showcase their talents.
> Enjoy!

Snow Day

Schools Out
It's a snow day today and I want to have some fun
I want to build a snow man and go sledding
And after that we'll have hot chocolate

Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever

Snow Man!

I built two balls and I grab some coal for the eyes
And got a hat with a train on the front
It was hard to make a smile so I made him smoking

Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever

Sledding!

The sled was purple and it fit three people
We went down over two bumps
The first one was pretty sturdy
And the second one we all fell off

Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever

Hot Chocolate!

I grabbed some Nesquick and a Swiss Milk packet, Hershey syrup also
But the most import of all is
ONE CUP OF MILK!

Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever
Snow day
The best day ever
