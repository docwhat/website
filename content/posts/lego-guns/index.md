[![Broomhandled

I like [LEGO](http://lego.com/) and have since I was a little kid. As an
adult, I've gone through phases of enjoying LEGO and just keeping it safe in
storage. However, now that I own a house, I think I'll make space for my LEGO
collection so I can play with it.

I doubt I can make room for my fun 4 foot by 8 foot
[MDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-density_fibreboard) table, but I
think I can make some space in our hobby room. Or maybe down stairs in the
"living room".

Either way, someone was kind enough to give me some
[PayPal](http://paypal.me/holtje/5.99) money (as thanks for my work on _It's
All Text!_), which I plan on spending on some custom LEGO:
[firearms](http://brickarms.com/)!

Cool!
