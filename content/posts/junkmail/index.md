My [mother](http://dianewillis.com/), who has a lot of friends that send her
hoaxes, email chain letters and other forms of internet tomfoolery on a
regular basis, got an email from [41 Pounds](http://41pounds.org/). 41 Pounds
claims that they will stop your US Postal junk mail if you give them money.

I took a quick look around and found similar services at
[StopTheJunkMail](http://stopthejunkmail.com) and
[Greendimes](http://greendimes.com/).

I cannot tell if these are legit or not; Doing searches on the internet are
largely self referential. The problem with this kind of service is that they
could, in theory, sign you up for the
[Direct Marketing Association](http://the-dma.org/)'s
[do-not-mail list](https://www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing) and stop
there. You would notice a decrease in mail and everything else they could say,
"Well, we stopped a whole lot. We can't be perfect." How could you tell?

The best way to ensure that you don't get any more junk mail is to
[do it your self](http://www.obviously.com/junkmail/). You'll know what
happened, how to do it again, and if you want to give money to charities you
can do that directly.

Ciao!
