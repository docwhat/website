Since I have an
[Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android 'Wikipedia article on Google Android')
phone I have to write software for it.  To write software for the phone, I
have to use
[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 'Wikipedia article for Java').

I've been looking around for something like
[Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/) but for Java.  So far, no luck.

Any recommendations would be very welcome.<!-- more -->

A friend who does work on
an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin/extension recommended the
[Sun Java tutorials](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/) but says:

> I never really used it as a "course".  i.e. I didn't start from the
> beginning and go chapter by chapter. I think I like it because it is
> organized by subject, so you can just jump down to whatever you are
> interested in.  I never really found an actual physical book that I liked.

Another friend has loaned me
[Learning Java](https://amzn.to/2pFIIuT) and [Java In A Nutshell](https://amzn.to/2IPcCWp).

I took the Sun web course on Java about 5 years ago, but I don't remember much
about it.  The courses spent too much time on things found in all languages
and not enough about what makes Java different than, say, Python or C++.

Ciao!
