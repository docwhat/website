title: How to rename a Chef node
---

In [Chef](http://getchef.com) the `node_name` is for human usage. By default
it is set to the `fqdn`. Which is annoying for typing.

In my network, all hosts have the same domain name. However, we
`knife bootstrap`ed this one system without setting the node name with the
`-N` flag.

Therefore I wanted to rename the nodes. With some experimentation, I figured
it out.

## Example

Let's say I have a node called `george.example.com` but I want to change the
node name to just `george`.

1.  `sh›knife node edit 'george.example.com'`
    -   Change the `node_name` to `george` (deleting the `.example.com`)
    -   When you're done, `knife` will say it is making a copy.
2.  `sh›knife node delete 'george.example.com'`
3.  `sh›knife client delete 'george.example.com'`
4.  `sh›knife client create -d 'george'`
    -   Copy the newly created private key.
5.  Connect to `george.example.com` as root/Administrator.
6.  Paste the new private key into `/etc/chef/client.pem`.
7.  Edit `/etc/chef/client.rb`
    -   Either add or edit the `node_name` line exists, changing it to
        `node_name "george"`
    -   Alternatively, if you use the
        [chef-client cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client)
        (recommended!) run `chef-client -N george` and it'll update
        `client.rb` for you.
8.  If you use the chef-client daemon, restart it:
    `sh›/etc/init.d/chef-client restart`

That's it!

It's important to understand that nodes and clients are tied together only via
their names. The node contains the status, etc. The client only contains the
public key that is needed for communicating.

You can't rename or copy clients. So you have to delete it and recreate it
with a new name. `knife client create` command generates a new private and
public key. You have to save private key and put it on the client server
because the chef-server doesn't store it.

If you ever lose the private key for a client, you can use
`knife client reregister` to regenerate the private key again.

Ciao!
