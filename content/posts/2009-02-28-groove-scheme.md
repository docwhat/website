Okay, I just recently discovered
[Groove Armada](http://www.groovearmada.com/ 'Groove Armada home page').  I
really like their music (and I'm not entirely sure why).

Two guys started a club, called Groove Armada and then put out a CD of the
music they performed.  The CD was well received and so they kept at it.

Currently, they tour with a huge band performing their grooves around the
world in giant concert-slash-parties.

Here's where it gets interesting.<!-- more -->

When their contract expired with their record label, they declined to sign
back up.  Instead, they signed up for a one year deal with
[b-live-share](http://www.bliveshare.com/share/jl2ymuK4yMy8jg91gF0t/docwhat),
a music sharing site  run by [Bacardi](http://www.bacardi.com/) (yup, the
booze guys).

This site entices you to sign up to get one free song.  You then get another
free song after getting more friends to sign up.

That's right, it's a music sharing
[~~Ponzi scheme~~](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) [multi-level pyramid scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_pyramid_scheme).
 Early sharers will do great as the pool of available friends to share with is
large.  Later sharers will do worse as the pool of available friends shrinks.

At least there isn't the physically limited constraint of money trickling up;
the music is digital downloads so infinite copies can be made.

_sigh_

Well, at the least I can offer you one free song:

Ciao!

Ponzi scheme.\]
