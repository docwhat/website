There is this great documentary called
"[BBS the documentary](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/ "Link to the documentary's homepage")"
by Jason Scott. It's an amazing documentary about computer bulliten boards and
it's 5 and 1/2 hours long with tons of extras.

For those who don't remember BBSes: You would use a modem to dial up a
computer system that had one or more modems and you could send messages (like
email) and download files (like ftp) and play online games.

Why was this amazing? There was no real internet, no email, and no web. This
was the way you talked to people and transfered files, etc.

I didn't know about this documentary until I met Jason Scott (proprietor of
the [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com) history site) at
[Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/ 'Official Penguicon site') 6.0. He had a
presentation about his next documentary
"[Get Lamp](http://www.getlamp.com/ 'Official Get Lamp documentary site')"
which will be about interactive fiction. As a huge Infocom fan I'm really
interested and can't wait for it to come out.

Later on, Robin and I met him in the hall and we spent some time talking about
his documentaries and such. We had a good time talking to him and even Robin
got interested in what he was talking about. So I ordered it when we got back
and it arrived last week.

It's a bit much to watch in one go but it comes in handy half hour byte size
chunks, so you can take breaks. ;-)

I heartily recommend it.
