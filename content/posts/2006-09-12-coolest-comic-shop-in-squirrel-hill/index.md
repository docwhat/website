**UPDATE**: _[Copacetic Comics](http://www.copaceticcomics.com/) has moved out
of Squirrel Hill and moved their web pages. Some of the links below may not
work._

It's one of those things I try to find when I move someplace. I use
[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) and the phonebook to find them and then
I visit them all.

But somehow, I missed one and it was only 4 blocks away!

it's a great comic shop, too! It's
[3 blocks](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1505+asbury,+pittsburgh,+pa&ie=UTF8&z=15≪=40.442734,-79.920774&spn=0.01411,0.041499&om=1&iwloc=A)
from Forbes in Squirrel Hill, next to the Police Department on Northumberland
between Murray and Shady.

Oh, and it's called
[Copacetic Comic Company](http://www.copaceticcomics.com/).

I visited the first time, on Thursday, just to check out where it was. I went
there right after work and checked it out. I was very impressed. I bought a
bunch of comics I hadn't picked up yet anyplace else (in part because some
were new, like Osamu Tezuka's Buddha: Devadatta, vol. 3 in trade paperback),
not always at my regular comic haunts (like Krazy Kat — 1931-1932) or strange
things, like
[McSweeney's Quarterly Concern](http://home.earthlink.net/~copaceticcomicsco/mcsweeneys.html)
issue \#19. I was impressed and decided to visit again.

I brought Robin along on a Saturday. She's my ultimate comic store critic. She
hasn't been too happy with any of the shops in the area and generally leaves
before I do. When it took her over 15 minutes just to enter the store, past
the small shelf and box outside, I knew that it was a great place.

comics](copacetic-shelves1.png 'So many comics')

And the thing that makes it great: the selection. I don't mean selection like
Barnes and Nobles does; I mean selection as in each book was selected by
someone who knew what was good and what wasn't and (more importantly) what
will be good. It's obvious the instant you enter the shop; Someone carefully
chose what should and shouldn't be in the store.

The store is a tiny place. It looks like someone's mud room had had it's walls
covered with book shelves and filled with comics. A chair sits in the corner
([comfy](http://people.csail.mit.edu/paulfitz/spanish/script.html) of course)
near the front window. I don't think I could actually sit for very long with
that many books to look at.

![photo: Do the comics ever
end?](copacetic-shelves2.png 'Do the comics ever end?')
The inventory consists of various books, trade paperback comics, some DVDs,
CDs, and a few other odds and ends. As I said before, it is obvious that
everything has been selected because it's good and interesting. The store
stocks a bunch of local and self-published comics in addition to the more
normal kind. I usually ignore the front window in a store, but Robin pointed
out that two of the comics that I bought were actually in the window. Next
time I go, I'll check out the window display first.

And if that weren't enough, here's the part that makes this comic store great:
_everything_ is cheaper than cover price. It's strange; like discovering that
the [Tooth Fairy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy) not only exists,
but lives down the street across from
[Eris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris). If a book doesn't have a price,
it's 10% off the cover price.

So, if you have a hankering for a good comic store, then head on out to
[Copacetic Comic Company](http://www.copaceticcomics.com/).
