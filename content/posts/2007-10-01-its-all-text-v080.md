I have just released version 0.8.0 of
"[It's All Text!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125)", the
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) extension that answers the
age old question, "What happens when you give a yo-yo to a flock of
flamingoes?"[^1]

### New Features

So, this version has several months of minor changes collected together. I
kind of lost track of all of them, but here are the obvious ones from looking
at the change log.

-   Hot Key support
-   Configure which corner to put the edit button on.
-   The edit button goes away when you aren't hovering or focusing the
    textarea. This lets you click buttons under where the edit button appears.
-   An attempt to clean up possible memory problems.
-   Code is GPL v3

So, [get it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) while it's
hot!

Ciao!
