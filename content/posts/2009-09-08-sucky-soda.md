I am not a soda fan.

I don't like Pepsi, Coke, etc. They taste like chemicals to me.

The last soda I like was an orange Fanta I got in a McDonalds in Germany. It
did not taste like anything I've gotten in the US. It was not sickly sweet and
actually tasted good.

I've come to realize that part of the reason for this is high fructose corn
syrup, but that isn't all of it. I think the sodas in America are just
horrible.

And things like this video from <http://chow.com/> pretty much prove that the
big US sodas are crap.

Does anyone know of a store in Pittsburgh like
[Soda Pop Stop](http://www.sodapopstop.com/)? Wandering around the store would
be more informative (and fun) than ordering online, I think.
