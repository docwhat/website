[![Drop

I started playing with
[Dropbox](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE0MDAyODY5) a few weeks ago
and it's pretty cool.

DropBox stores files in the "cloud", which isn't all that new.

However, their software that pushes and pulls files automatically behind the
scenes is the really cool part.

I've been using it in OS X and Linux and both systems are pretty similar: You
have a folder called Dropbox. Anything you drop in it automatically is copied
to their servers and then to your other systems.

So I can drop something in Dropbox on my laptop and it is quickly becomes
available on my desktop.

It comes with 2 gigs free but you can pay to upgrade to 50 gigs or 100 gigs.
Not unreasonable, but I only need the internet version of a USB stick.

Ciao!

PS: All the links I provided are referrals. Â If you use that then we both get
free extra space.
