It looks like EA decided to listen to their customers (and would-be
customers):

[Answering your feedback about Spore Online Accounts](http://forum.spore.com/jforum/posts/list/2897.page).

<!-- more -->

Short summary: They will add screen names, allowing 5 people to share the same
account.

This is good news. Other announcements that they have made include: bumping
the number of hardware activations from 3 to 5. Adding the ability to
deactivate a hardware deactivation (so you don't have to contact EA support if
you upgrade the hardware too much).

DRM sucks as a whole but at least EA is trying to make it less of a hassle. I
still recommend that you only use SPORE on a Mac; the windows version of
SecuROM seems to hork up windows systems, sometimes in unobvious ways.

Ciao!
