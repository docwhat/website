I found this excellent article, _Mac OS X SSD tweaks_ (defunct as of 2022) by
Ricardo Gameiro, and have stolen two of the ideas for my non-SSD MacBook Pro
laptop. I'll cover all three, though, since I don't agree with his hibernation
trick.

## Turn off "atime"

This is pretty simple. Setting `noatime` turns off recording of when files are
accessed. I've never found a usage for the recording of file accesses.
However, you may have a use for this behavior, so be warned.

To turn off `atime` then just dump this XML into
`/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.nullvision.noatime</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>mount</string>
            <string>-vuwo</string>
            <string>noatime</string>
            <string>/</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true />
    </dict>
</plist>
```

## Turn off hibernate

In the article, he suggests turning off hibernate altogether. I don't like
this. The hibernate is really handy if something goes wrong and you loose all
your power.

There are two ways OS-X goes to sleep: suspend and hibernate.

The first is suspend. Information on the system state is stored to ram and the
CPU is stopped. This is really fast to sleep and really fast to restore. The
downside is that if the system looses power, it cannot restore; the ram is
wiped clean.

The second is hibernate. Information on the system state is stored to disk and
the CPU is stopped. The system is powered off. On restart, the state is read
from disk and the system restarts as normal. This is slow to sleep and
restore, but if power is lost, the system state is still safe.

OS-X, for laptops, does both. This means it is slow to shutdown, but fast to
restore.

Obviously, if you are using SSD or if you want shutdowns to be fast (like I
do, since I tend to shut my lid and carry around my laptop immediately), then
you really don't want hibernation to happen unless you really need it.

So I use [SmartSleep](http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html) by Patrick Stein.
The only time my laptop hibernates is when the power is low. The best of both
worlds.

## Storing `/tmp/` in ram

This recipe is nearly the same as Ricardo's suggestion. I just added the code
from _Patrick Gibson's comment_ (defunct).

This is two part; you need to create a shell script and a `.plist` file.

The shell script goes in `/var/root/ramfs.sh`. You must do a
`chmod a+x /var/root/ramfs.sh` afterwards.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

ramfs_size_mb=256
mount_point="/private/tmp"

ramfs_size_sectors=$(( ${ramfs_size_mb} * 1024 * 1024 / 512 ))
ramdisk_dev=$(hdid -nomount ram://${ramfs_size_sectors} | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
newfs_hfs -v 'Volatile HD' "${ramdisk_dev}"
mkdir -p "${mount_point}"
mount -o noatime -t hfs "${ramdisk_dev}" "${mount_point}"

# hide the volume from the Finder
if [ -e /usr/bin/SetFile ]; then
 /usr/bin/SetFile -a V "${mount_point}"
fi

# fix permissions
chown root:wheel "${mount_point}"
chmod 1777 "${mount_point}"

# EOF
```

Next you need to drop a `.plist` file in
`/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.ramfs.plist`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.nullvision.ramfs</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/var/root/ramfs.sh</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true />
    </dict>
</plist>
```

I don't recommend moving any caches or anything, as he mentions at the end of
the article. Just having `/tmp/` (aka `/private/tmp/`) will be an advantage.
Well, except the X-Code thing. That's probably useful.

Ciao!

## Addendum: Reverting `/tmp`

I discovered that [iDefrag2](http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php)
needs to have `/tmp` be a real file-system to do it's "No bootable CD/DVD
required!" trick. After hashing it out with a helpful developer (Thanks,
Chris!) we tracked it down to putting `/tmp` into ram.

To undo it, run these commands as root:

```bash
rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.ramfs.plist
rm /var/root/ramfs.sh
mkdir /private/tmp2
mv /private/tmp /private/tmp2 ; mv /private/tmp2 /private/tmp
chown root:wheel /private/tmp
chmod 1777 /private/tmp
```

You should reboot immediately after this change.

After reboot, verify that `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` are set up correctly:

```bash
$ ls -ald /tmp /private/tmp
drwxrwxrwt 18 root wheel 612 Jun 16 09:47 /private/tmp/
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root admin  11 Jun 16 09:23 /tmp -> private/tmp/
```

**Important:** Verify that the `/tmp` symlink points to `private/tmp` not
`/private/tmp`!
