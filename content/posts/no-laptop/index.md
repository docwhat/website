title: 'My laptop has died'
---

My laptop has died a horrible death and I'm not happy about it. I bought it
about 3 years ago from Linux Certified, way back when Linux laptops was a
novel concept.

It flat out won't power up. There is power from the power cord (checked it
with a multi-meter), but the light won't light, the power won't pow and the
battery won't batter.

This will slow down my blogging, emailing, and working on _It's All Text!_

This comes at a bad time since I just bought a house. \*sigh\*

On the plus side, there are two companies
([EmperorLinux](http://www.emperorlinux.com/) and
[System76](http://system76.com/)) selling laptops with Linux pre-installed.
And Apple's MacBook Pro [runs Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBookPro) (and
even under
[Parallels](http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/11/01/how-to-install-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-in-parallels-desktop-for-os-x/)).

I have to admit, I like the Apple designed hardware. I've been a fan since I
took apart my old clamshell laptop. It was all very clever and well built. And
I can tell the newer stuff is even better.

So, does anyone have any suggestions or ideas?

Ciao!

UPDATE \[2007-11-29\]: I have ordered a Macbook Pro and Parallels. I have my
Ubuntu CD and stickers ready. I still have to pry my hard-drive out of the old
laptop and hook it up some how to recover my old data. \*sigh\* I wish my
laptop hadn't died.
