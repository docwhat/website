For those that use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/ 'Cygwin') on Windows, Mike
Hostetler has a
[post detailing how to use Cygwin editors](http://mike.hostetlerhome.com/2010/03/04/getting-its-all-text-to-play-with-cygwin/ "Getting It's All Text to play with Cygwin")
with It's All Text!

<!-- more -->

He's using it to play with emacs and emacsclient, but it'll probably work for
using the Cygwin vim. I bet it also works with
[Cygwin/X](http://x.cygwin.com/ 'Cygwin/X').

I'm always impressed at the new ways people find to use IAT.

Ciao!
