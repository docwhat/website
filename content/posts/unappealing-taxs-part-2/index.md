I just got the "Disposition of appeal from real estate assessment". This is
also known as the ruling. In short, it says that the "evidence insufficient to
change value"; no change. Yay!

The only recourse the city has now is to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas
of Allegheny County within thirty days. I hope they don't since I believe this
is a civil court and that means that I would have to actually know what the
heck I was doing. Or hire someone who does.
