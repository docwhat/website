A quick Doctor What Product Suggestion: The
[iKlear Complete Cleaning Kit](https://amzn.to/2txV8aH) is great.

I thought at first that it was a stupid overkill for the price; I mean it only
has a few cloths and some cleaning solution.

<!-- more -->

But I really wanted the little cloth to protect the screen. I've seen how
horrible MacBook screens can get from keyboard scum.

However, after I bought it I really liked the cloths and the cleaner. The
extra cloths are really nice and big; the cleaner actually really works well.
All in all I think it was worth it.

I was reminded of how helpful it was when I had a slight "drinking problem"
and spewed beer across my screen and keyboard. :-(

After it dried out, the iKlear stuff did a great job removing it.

Ciao!
