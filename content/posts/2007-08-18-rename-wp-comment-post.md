Here's a simple recipe to cut down on comment spam in
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). I assume you have basic understanding of
Unix commands or can translate them to windows.

<!-- more -->

1.  Make a directory in the root of your WordPress file system called `post`.
2.  Create a file in the directory called `index.php` with the following
    contents:

    ```php
    < ?php
    include("../wp-comments-post.php");
    ?>
    ```

3.  Modify the form `comments.php` in your theme to point to `/post/` instead
    of `/wp-comments-post.php`
4.  Add the following
    [RewriteRule](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule)
    to your ".htaccess" files to block "wp-comments-post.php":

    ```apache
    RewriteRule ^/wp-comments-post.php - [F,L]
    ```

Is this a perfect solution? No, it isn't; spammers will work around it, using
scripts that read your blog posts first to get the correct page to post to.
But it does slow down a spammer. To a spammer, time is money, so a
mass-spammer will be less likely use it. For an unpopular blog like my own, it
isn't worth it for a spammer to work around this problem (or even notice it is
a problem). However, if you own a super popular blog, this won't add much
protection because the reward to the spammer is high enough that the extra
cost is worthwhile.

I hope this helps you. :-)

BTW: If you use the
[Permalink-Redirect](http://fucoder.com/code/permalink-redirect/) plugin, then
you can change that `RewriteRule` to:

```apache
RewriteRule ^/(wp-comments-post|wp-trackback).php - [F,L]
```

Why? Because nobody parsing your HTML will ever get a link to
`/wp-trackback.php`!

Ciao!
