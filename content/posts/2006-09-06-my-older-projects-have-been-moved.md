This is really just administrata, due to my recent
[move to wordpress](/moving-to-a-blog/).

I had been moving my stuff over, bit by bit into a [Trac](# 'Broken Link')
installation (~~linky~~) but some things didn't really fit into it. One of
these days I might make a Trac for all my miscellaneous projects. Meanwhile,
till then, here is some links to these old unloved projects.

<!-- more -->

I have moved a bunch of my old CVS projects into ~~my svn repository~~. Things
like my Palm Powerbutton Hack, my Palm Launch Hack, an old perl bot and the
cuescan scan software.

Just in case anyone comes looking for them.

Ciao!
