There is a nifty new project for the Android phone:
[Android Scripting Environment](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/).

This lets you use [Lua](http://lua.org) and [Python](http://python.org/) to
write scripts on Android. Not quite the same as writing a whole application in
those languages, but a great start!
