There is a new <a href="http://macheist.com/">MacHeist</a> nanoBundle. For
\$20, it looks like some fun mac-ish tools to play with. Yeah, I’m one of
those people who can have fun simply playing with new software.

Hmm...I have apparently also posted 120 posts to my blog. Wow! I didn’t notice
till I played with
<a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85">MacJournal</a>.
And yes, this was posted via MacJournal.

Ciao!
