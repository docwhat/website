I found this article about
[Getting things done with mutt](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=106&tag=nl.e011).
It talks about using the techniques from David Allen's productivity book
"[Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://amzn.com/0142000280?tag=thedocwha-20).
I've been reading GTD for a week now (taking my time, you know) and think it's
pretty interesting.

Since [Mutt](http://mutt.org/) is my favorite email client, I spent a little
playing with it and making changes. I'm using a different
[editlabel](/files/editlabel) script and my way doesn't require patching and
recompiling mutt.

Here are my `muttrc` changes:

```

macro index \Cy "<limit>~y " "Limit view to label"

set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L %?M?(#%03M)&(%4l)? %?y?{%.20Y} ?%s"
#### END GTD ###
```

`editlabel` also has full [readline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readline)
editing and history, which is nice. I haven't added tab-completion from the
history; I'm not sure if I will or not.

My `editlabel` also has the advantage that you can delete a label just by
deleting the line; `^a ^k` if you use emacs.

Note that if you use the above, you'll have to replace the occurrences of
"emacs" with whatever editor you use.

I just found a similar post: [GTD with Mutt](http://footils.org/cms/show/59)

I like my `editlabel` better, even if I'm using [Python](http://python.org/)'s
evil `os.system()`. But that narrow-wide trick is neat.

Ciao!

1.  UPDATE 2007-10-08: Added mark-as-new when saving, so that they will
    attract my notice via the mailbox changing.
2.  UPDATE 2007-10-09: Fixed the mark-as-new stuff...had to use tagging to
    make it work.
3.  UPDATE 2010-03-01: Updated 'y' macro based on feedback from Mark Fardal.
4.  UPDATE 2014-08-11: Fixed broken formatting due to age. Fixed some minor
    typos.
