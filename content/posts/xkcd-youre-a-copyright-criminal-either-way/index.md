The always witting and intelligent web comic XKCD makes an excellent point
today:

[![XKCD 488: Steal this Comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/steal_this_comic.png)](https://xkcd.com/488/)

Of course, it's a false dichotomy for most people; they don't think about it
this way. For an example of this in the real world consider those that bought
[Walmart's DRM music](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/26/walmart-shutting-dow.html).

Their choices are either violate the
[DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (which
is still illegal even with Walmart's blessing and a waste of time and quality)
or lose their music.
