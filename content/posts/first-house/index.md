So, I haven't been blogging much lately. Part of the reason is that Robin and
I have been working on buying a new house.

This is very stressful and scary. We're almost done. We close on November
16th. I plan on blogging about the people and companies that provide excellent
service during the process. However, I'm waiting till I'm all done.

It's been a pain in a lot of reasons, and scary. I mean a house costs so much
money, it's insane! Sheesh!

Anyway, I have some
[photos](https://flickr.com/photos/docwhat/sets/72157602423731857/) up on
flickr if you want to look at it. It's a lovely 3 story house, detached in
Pittsburgh. It's a nice walk to the grocery store and only a few blocks from
work. It's move-in ready and no work is needed. I'm excited. And nervous.

I'll post more later; I'm off to be nervous.

Ciao!
