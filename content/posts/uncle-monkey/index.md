I'm an Uncle!

My sister gave birth to Alexander Bruce on Sunday. Both are doing well.

My mom gave me the details (weight, length, etc.) and I promptly forgot the
numbers; but the important part is that everyone survived the ordeal with
flying colors. :-)

I'll update this post when I get an email with the info in it. Naturally I'll
also add pictures as I get them.

Statistics:

<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Length</th>
<td>21"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Weight</th>
<td>8lbs. 12oz. (Roughly the weight of 4 guinea pigs. I was  8.5, my brother was 9 and my sister was 9.5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Hair</th>
<td>Brown</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Eyes</th>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/newborn/first_days/apgar.html">APGAR</a></th>
<td>10 (like I was!)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

I've been told the poor kid looks like I did as a newborn.

Yup, I can confirm that... he do. Lament for the
[poor kid at flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/docwhat/sets/72157621387476120/ 'Photos of Alexander Bruce').

Ciao!
