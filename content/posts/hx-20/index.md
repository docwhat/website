I was walking through Squirrel Hill today with Robin and my Dad. There was a
house with some junk on their porch and a sign saying, "For sale. \$1 each." I
looked through the stuff and found an
[Epson HX-20](http://oldcomputers.net/hx-20.html)!

_Oh. My. Gawd!_

When I was in High School a guy named Randy had a
[TRS80 Model 100](http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/trs80-model100/)
portable computer (made in 1983). It was the coolest thing. I got him to loan
it to me so I could write a small text adventure (only like 6 rooms, but a
huge deal at the time).<!-- more -->

Anyway, back to the present.

I paid the lady her \$1 and took it with me. I thought at worst, it wouldn't
work or would be stupid or something. It'd be a buck wasted and I'd give it to
[Bill von Hagen](http://www.vonhagen.org/ 'Ex-Punk rocker, book author, and computer-phile.')
who'd add it to his collection, even if it's not working.

I just discovered that the wall-wart that came with it was a
[6v @ 600mA wall-wart](http://www.xs4all.nl/~fjkraan/comp/hx20/adapter.html)
not 6v 300ma I got. Since it charges the NiCd batteries directly (don't try to
run it plugged in!) I don think it matters much. Except it'll charge slower.

The computer had no [wall-wart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply) or
it's carrying case (I didn't know when I bought it for \$1 that it even had a
carrying case). But I took one of the other wall-warts the lady was selling
that matched the specs and charged it at home.

**It works!**

I even found the old
[manuals](http://support.epson.com/hardware/computer/portable/hx20__/index.html)
on-line and [software](http://www.geocities.com/abcmcfarren/hx20/hx20.htm).

Wow. This is cool.

It has two Hitachi 6301 CPUs and even a built in printer, for goodness sake.
How cool is that. I figure at worst, I can open it up and replace the
batteries with regular batteries or something. It uses NiCd batteries, I have
no clue how old they are.

Ciao!
