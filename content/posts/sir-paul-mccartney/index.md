On Tuesday, I saw Paul McCartney at Citi Field.

It was <strong>AWESOME</strong>!!!

I played hooky from work to travel to New York. My brother scored the tickets
and my Dad paid. How could I say no?

The concert was great. He did a bunch of his songs, a couple from wings, a
bunch of Beatles songs and one John Lennon song (<em>Give Peace a Chance</em>
with lots of audience participation).

His part of the concert was two and a half hours long.

I cannot tell you how awesome it was. I loved it. I'm still on a high from it
five days later.

We were on the field it self, not in the A section (alas) but still close
enough to make out the band on stage.

I screamed, shouted, clapped and stomped with the rest and the whole thing was
great. Sir McCartney gives awesome concerts.

Sorry for over using the word "awesome" but ... it was!

I'll add images on Flickr later, between my Dad, brother and myself we had a
lot of photos to go through.

I had to run out and reserve my copies of

do anyway?
