A disclaimer: I'm writing this just to share (and record for myself) this one
stupid trick in JavaScript. While I'm here, I thought I should
[kvetch](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvetch) about most JavaScript usage.

First, the stupid trick.

Have you ever been on a page and you try to control-click or right-click on a
link only to discover that the link is something stupid? Such as:

```
javascript:window.open(‘http://someurl/’);
```

<!-- more -->The underlying HTML for this looks like so:

```html
You should click on this:
<a href="javascript: window.open(’http://someurl/’); ">link</a>
```

What this is is a popup link. When you click on it and it'll pop up a new
window. It isn't a real URL. It can't be opened in a new tab. It cannot be
bookmarked. It cannot be saved. It doesn't work if JavaScript is disabled or
has a bug in it.

The solution is one of these things that should be obvious once it's
explained. Instead of making the `href` useless by filling it with the
`javascript:` junk, you use a real URL. And then use the `onclick` attribute
to fetch the `href` and open it in a new window.

Example:

```html
You should click on this:
<a
    href="http://someurl/"
    onclick="try{window.open(this.href,’_blank’);
               event.returnValue = false;
               return false;}
               catch(e){event.returnValue = true; return true;}"
    >link</a
>
```

This will work even with JavaScript disabled. It'll work even if I made a
mistake in the JavaScript. The `event.returnValue = boolean` and
`return boolean` parts are important. If you return `false` then the browser
will assume that the `onclick` event isn't handled and won't continue. If you
return `true` or don't use return, then the browser assumes that you didn't
handle the `onclick` event and then do the normal thing (open the link). And
IE 7 needs the `event.returnValue` and won't hurt any other browser.

Now, onto the kvetch.

Notice that this isn't much harder. Notice how this is easier to validate.
Notice how it delivers to the user the expected behavior.

Why isn't this done more often. I hate it when I visit some site, hover over
the link to see the URL and get JavaScript junk instead.

This requires more work when you have a complicated URL to generate, but with
the ability to change the DOM tree directly there is no excuse.

Keeping everything working the way your user expects it to work is an
important principle in user interface design and engineering. Ignore it at
your peril.

### UPDATED 2006-1-12

Okay, for those keeping score,
[IE 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Criticism) continues the
tradition of
[sucking](http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/archives/explorer_7/index.html).

I can add another bug to IE 7's growing list. I tried to make a simple test
case. But when I make it simple it starts working correctly. Bah. I don't have
enough patience or desire to do this much work -- for free -- for a company
with as many employees and dollars as Microsoft -- for a browser I don't own
and only use to find and fix bugs like this.

Basically, under certain circumstances, onclick's return value is ignored. In
this case, we had an `A` tag that used the trick mentioned above. So that
meant the popup url would appear in both the parent window and the popup
window.

The work around? Set `javascript›event.returnValue` right before returning.
Bleh. The code has been updated.
