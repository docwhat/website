Great jumping Jesus in a sidecar with chocolate jimmies! Google has released
their own browser, [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). They even
created a comic book,
[_Google Chrome_](https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/), drawn by
[Scott McCloud](http://www.scottmccloud.com/) (author of
[_Zot!_](https://amzn.to/2DRHzoY)).

I'm not sure what I think.

On the one hand I feel that browsers do need an overhaul. When they crash (and
they do) they take everything down.
[SSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Specific_Browser)s show us that parts
of the web are actually applications and should be treated as such. The
security models in most browsers are built around concepts that no longer make
sense.

On the other hand: why create yet another browser? Safari, Firefox, IE and now
this one?

But maybe the market needs another shake up. Safari & Webkit shook things up a
little but because it only runs reliably on OS X it ultimately didn't have
much impact; except maybe as an example of how much a web page can look if the
browsers supported more features.

Either way, I can't wait till the Linux and Mac versions come out.

Ciao!
