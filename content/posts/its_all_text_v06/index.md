Get [_It's All Text!_](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125)

I wrote
[_It's All Text!_](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) for
myself. When [Firefox](http://mozilla.com/) 2.0 was released it broke
[MozEx](http://mozex.mozdev.org/) so I went looking for a replacement. The
others weren't very good. So I set about fixing MozEx. It was then that I
realized that MozEx had way more stuff in it than I needed and some parts were
just a pain to maintain.

The author of MozEx got it working with FireFox 2.0 eventually. But I had this
itch because I saw things I can improve.

Now it's three months later and I've released version 0.6.1 now that
[Addons](http://addons.mozilla.org/) is back. This will be my release
candidate for 1.0 because I have fixed the four most annoying problems:

-   The edit button is in the right place. If it isn't perfect, it's really
    close. Even for [GMail](http://gmail.com/) and
    [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org).
-   Right clicking on the edit button lets you pick a file extension.
-   When the user first starts or the editor isn't in the right place, it
    explains to the user what happened and what to do about it.
-   The rules for when and what to refresh finally seem right. At least for
    me… ;-)

The last big bug I want to do something for, even if I can't fix it, is the
"Mac OS X select an editor that actually is a .app directory" problem. It's
hard for me to work on because I have to borrow my wifes Mac to work on it.

The versions up to now, as flawed as they have been, have actually gotten some
really good feedback both in ~comments~ on this site and on
[addons](http://addons.mozilla.org/) and even from blogs in
[Switzerland](http://www.libellules.ch/dotclear/index.php?2007/03/05/1738-it-s-all-text)
and [Japan](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nyama/)! Note: I have been told that the
addons comments are still in the process of being moved from the old site to
the new one.

[Jason Barnabe](http://blog.userstyles.org/), the author of the excellent
[Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2108/) extension for Firefox has
helped design an
[API](http://blog.userstyles.org/2007/03/13/extension-integration-its-all-text/)
for It's All Text! so that you can use an external editor in Stylish or in any
other extension that decides it wants to support It's All Text!

Finally, if you design a website, you can add the attribute
`itsalltext-extension` to any `textarea` and it'll be the default extension
used for that `textarea` (don't forget the leading dot, `.`). You can see it
below in the "Leave a comment" box.

I want to thank everyone who has given me all this great feedback. Even people
telling me it doesn't work is helpful. Every comment spurred me on to make it
better so I really owe it's current level of usability to all of you. Please,
give yourselves a hand.

I can't wait to see what feedback I get next. Yay!

Ciao!

EDIT (2007/04/04): I'm so stupid. Thankfully,
[Robert Daeley](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2387) explained
[exactly what I didn't understand](http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2007/02/firefox_plugin_its_all_text.html)
about Mac OS X. I need to use `/usr/bin/open` on Mac OS X. Now that I
understand what `open` is and why it should be used, I will finally have that
part of Mac OS X fixed in short order. Now I just need to figure out make the
close button not be `css›display: none` in preferences. Grrrr.
