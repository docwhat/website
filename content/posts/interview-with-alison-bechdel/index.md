If you aren't into comic art, skip this...

I found a video of an interview with
[Alison Bechdel](http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/alison-bechdel) a really good
comic artist. I loved her autobiographical book
[_Fun Home_](http://amzn.to/2FZvzHn). The story was engaging and the art was
so enjoyable to look at.

In the video she is working on her next book,
[_Are You My Mother?_](http://amzn.to/2Ixrxo1) a follow up to to _Fun Home_.
She is being interviewed by an English professor, Hillary Chute, from the
University of Chicago (Yay! Hyde Park!).

_Fun Home_ was about her father and how she discovered she was gay while
living in rural Pennsylvania. I definitely wanted to read more, so I'm excited
she's working on another book about her life.
