title: 'A bug report from Japan...'
---

Wow! I found a blog post talking about
[It's All Text!](http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4125) on a blog called
[Another 朝顔日記](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nyama/) written in Japanese!

According to babelfish, the author
[found a silly bug](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nyama/20070309/1173408162) in It's
All Text! (I left out a `var` declaration) and is explaining the way to fix
this. Neat!

<!-- more -->

I have fixed it, of course. But I can't help thinking how useful this would
have been back when I worked at
[TurboLinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbolinux).

I actually wrote some palm software way back, and I got calls from Japanese
magazines that wanted to put my software on a CD in their magazine. My
software was GPL'ed, so they didn't really have at ask. I requested that they
send a copy of the magazines to me. Many months later, I was pleased to
receive two of them.

I really want to go to [Akihabara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara)
some day. It sounds like geek paradise. :-)

Ciao!
