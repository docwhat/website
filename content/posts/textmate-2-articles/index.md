Last week, TextMate 2.0 early-alpha
[was released](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/). This
release has been a long-time coming. It includes lots of improvements that
people have wanted for a long time.

I am currently a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) user. Mainly because I'm
an OS X and do Ruby programing and TextMate has lots of things to make this
easier. I still love Emacs, though. One of the things I've been waiting for
has been mark-and-select (a.k.a. control-space in Emacs). I haven't seen it
yet, but then again, I'm only starting to play with TM2.

This is just a post to place all the helpful links, posts, etc. into one place
so I can stop leaving open tabs in my browser (and so you can see them too).

-   [rmate](http://erniemiller.org/2011/12/12/textmate-2-rmate-awesome/) is a
    way to open textmate from a remote system. Using it securely requires
    setting up SSH forwarding.
-   A new site: [TextMate 2 tips](http://tm2tips.tumblr.com/)
-   [.tm_properties](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/git-style-configuration/)
    is the new way to configure projects.
-   ~A [Whitespace Bundle](.) that shows invalid white space (think
    `git diff --check`).~

Ciao!
