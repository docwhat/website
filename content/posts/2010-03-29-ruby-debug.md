There is a ruby-debugger gem which is very handy for trouble shooting problems
in a ruby script. The built in debugging is quite powerful and worth learning
to use.

<!-- more -->

First off, install ruby-debug:

```bash
# If using ruby1.8
$ gem install ruby-debug

# If using ruby 1.9.1
$ gem install ruby-debug19
```

Next: Watch this video....

-   [Link to video: Basics of Ruby Debug](http://cardero.textdrive.com/~eventualbuddha/ruby-debug-1-basics.mov)

The big thing to remember is `help` is your friend.

Finally: A handy `~/.rdebugrc` file:

```bash
# rdebugrc
set autolist   on
set autoeval   on
set autoreload on
# EOF
```

Ciao!
