Alrighty! I have me a new look and it is FRESH. :wink:

I got sick of working around some of the problems in
[sandbox](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/). I don't want to maintain
an offshoot of an existing theme (or worse, code my own); I've done that
before it I don't like it.

So using some simple patches to add some extra
[semantic markup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) to the default
wordpress theme, I created this page.

<!-- more -->

Notice how it has a nice
[fluid grid](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluidgrids 'A List Apart article about Fluid Grids') and
how it handles resizing very well.  The CSS is actually kind of
straight-forward too.  Though it could be minimized more, which I'll do
eventually.

I also downloaded WPTouch and will be playing with that shortly.

w00t!

PS: I'm not trying to bad-mouth sandbox. It's a great theme.  It's just that
it hasn't been maintained or improved for a while. Wordpress 2.7 has lots of
spiffy new features and sandbox doesn't make use of them.  Worse, some of the
features are similar, but not quite the same; plugins break on sandbox because
of that.  And of course, the developer is trying to
[sell it off](http://www.plaintxt.org/2009/01/looking-for-a-wordpress-brand/).
:confused:
