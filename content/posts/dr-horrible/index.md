For those that are fans of [Joss Whedon](http://whedonesque.com/), he has
started releasing his mini/limited-time/videopod/series,
"[Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog](http://drhorrible.com/)".<!-- more -->

It stars Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day. Neil Patrick
Harris was
[Doogie Howser, M.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doogie_Howser,_M.D. 'Wikipedia Article for Doogie Howser')
of course. Nathan Fillion was "Mal" from
[Firefly](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)> 'Wikipedia article for Firefly'),
the cult favorite sci-fi show that somehow bombed on T.V. Felicia Day I had
only seen before on [The Guild](http://www.watchtheguild.com/) which was
so-so.

Each episode will be released every two days after July 15th.
