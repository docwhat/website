Are you having trouble with SSL on El Capitan (OS X 10.11)?

Me too.

Here are the things I know about it right now:

1.  OS X's OpenSSL is ancient (0.9.8-ish).
1.  <ins datetime="2016-08-23T14:57:34+00:00">OS X's preferred SSL library is
    SecureTransport which is modern and secure.</ins>
1.  <ins datetime="2016-08-23T14:57:34+00:00">Some programs compiled with
    OpenSSL seem to use SecureTransport unless an OpenSSL-specific feature is
    requested (e.g. `SSL_CERT_FILE` or `SSL_CERT_DIR` is set).</ins>
1.  <del datetime="2016-08-23T14:57:34+00:00">SecureTransport (OS X's
    replacement for OpenSSL) may fall back to using OpenSSL if the environment
    variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` is set.</del>
1.  Lots of places are "cross-signing" their intermediate certs to upgrade
    from SHA-1 to SHA-2 for security reasons.
1.  OS X's OpenSSL cannot handle the intermediate cross-signing and report
    that it cannot verify certificates. SecureTransport handles this just
    fine.
1.  [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) applications usually don't support
    SecureTransport and instead use HomeBrew's OpenSSL.
1.  `/usr/bin/curl` uses SecureTransport directly, unless you set
    `SSL_CERT_FILE` (see above).

Normally, the above is just fine assuming you don't set the `SSL_CERT_FILE`
environment variable.

However, if you work for a company that uses internal certificates then life
begins to suck.

Usually <ins datetime="2016-08-23T14:57:34+00:00">you </ins>want to set
`SSL_CERT_FILE` so you can tell OpenSSL about the custom certificates but this
will break `curl` and anything else that uses SecureTransport. Like `curl`.

I _think_ the work-around is to not use `SSL_CERT_FILE` to update all the
`cert.pem` files the various OpenSSL versions use:

-   `/usr/local/etc/libressl/cert.pem` -- HomeBrew'd
    [LibreSSL](http://www.libressl.org/)
-   `/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem` -- HomeBrew'd OpenSSL
-   `/opt/chefdk/embedded/ssl/cert.pem` -- ChefDK's OpenSSL (installed via
    [BrewCask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask))
-   `/opt/vagrant/embedded/cacert.pem` -- Vagrant's OpenSSL (installed via
    [BrewCask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask))

This is frustrating.
