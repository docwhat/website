It looks like EA decided to listen to their customers (and would-be customers):

<a href="http://forum.spore.com/jforum/posts/list/2897.page">Answering your feedback about Spore Online Accounts</a>.

Short summary: They will add screen names, allowing 5 people to share the same account.

This is good news.  Other announcements that they have made include: bumping the number of hardware activations from 3 to 5. Adding the ability to deactivate a hardware deactivation (so you don't have to contact EA support if you upgrade the hardware too much).

DRM sucks as a whole but at least EA is trying to make it less of a hassle.  I still recommend that you only use SPORE on a Mac; the windows version of SecuROM seems to hork up windows systems, sometimes in unobvious ways.

Ciao!
