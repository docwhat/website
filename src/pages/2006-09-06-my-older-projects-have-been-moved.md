This is really just administrata, due to my recent [move to wordpress](http://docwhat.gerf.org/2006/09/moving-to-a-blog/).

I had been moving my stuff over, bit by bit into a [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) installation ([linky](http://trac.gerf.org/)) but some things didn't really fit into it. One of these days I might make a Trac for all my miscellaneous projects. Meanwhile, till then, here is some links to these old unloved projects.

I have moved a bunch of my old CVS projects into [my svn repository](http://svn.gerf.org/docwhat/). Things like my Palm Powerbutton Hack, my Palm Launch Hack, an old perl bot and the cuescan scan software.

Just in case anyone comes looking for them.

Ciao!
