- What I did at Penguicon 2007
---

Robin and I enjoyed [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/) 5.0 last weekend.
We went for the first time last year and we *knew* had to go again this
year (and next year and the year after that and…).

In case you don't know, Penguicon is a
[Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) geek, Sci-Fi
[fen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_fandom),
[Anime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) aficionado, and
[filk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk) listener convention. As one of
the founders described it, it's a "You have peanut butter in my
chocolate" type of [mashup](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mashup) that
works just great.

We were introduced to Penguicon by [Rob
Landley](http://www.landley.net/) who was one of the founders along with
Tracy Worcester. A couple of web
[memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) were created last year, like
[Tron Guy](http://www.tronguy.net/), and the [Liquid Nitrogen in the
Swimming Pool](http://youtube.com/watch?v=w2mj-Sq2oeo). Who knows what
memes will come out of this year's con.

A friend, Garrett, did an impromptu Geeks with Guns last year. This year
he planned it all out and we had a good time and a good turn out. We
went to [Firing Line](http://www.firinglineguns.com/) gun range. Robin
liked it because they had a good selection of firearms to choose from.

A regular activity at Penguicon is making [liquid nitrogen
ice-cream](https://flickr.com/photos/swthomas/466836040/). Always fun and
very tasty. [Howard Tayler](http://howardtayler.livejournal.com/)
usually makes some [chupaqueso](http://www.chupaqueso.com/)s, a
delicious combination of cheese, cheese and more cheese fried on a
griddle. Yum.

![Wizard
Mini](/files/2007/04/dscn0515-blogready.jpg)My
mini paint job.

This year Robin and I painted a
[mini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_figure_%28gaming%29) both
turned out pretty well. I also started sculpting a mini of my own, with
the help of [Andy Barlow](http://www.dark-platypus.com/). I think I'll
try sculpting some more. I went and got some of the bits I didn't have
already.

Robin and I attended the wedding of two friends, Rob Landley and [Fade
the Cat](http://fadethecat.livejournal.com/), which they squeezed in as
a private panel between events they both wanted to go to. It was very
nice and very unique. [Steve Jackson](http://www.io.com/~sj/) officiated
the ceremony and we swapped entertaining stories about the newlyweds.

Robin and I finally saw a [piece pack](http://www.piecepack.org/) in
person and played a game called [The Colonists of
Natick](http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/TheColonistsOfNatick). [Ron
Hale-Evans](http://ron.ludism.org/) (author of [Mind Performance
Hacks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0596101538%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0596101538%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02))
was nice enough to run us through most of a game using his copy of the
[Blue Panther](http://www.bluepantherllc.com/JCDPiecepack.htm) pretty
plastic tile version of the piece pack.

I finally saw Randy Milholland, the creator of [Something
Positive](http://www.somethingpositive.net/). I was disappointed that he
didn't look like any of his characters, like Davan or Choo-Choo Bear. He
gave me a [badge ribbon](http://penguicon.org/wiki/BadgeRibbons/) that
said "Ask me to show you where R. Milholland touched me." That drew a
few puzzled expressions. (He shook my hand, in case you wondered.)

I saw [Tom Smith](http://www.tomsmithonline.com/) and Robin bought one
of every CD he had that we didn't already have. We also saw [Frank
Hayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hayes) and finally bought a
copy of [Never Set the Cat on
Fire](http://www.firebirdarts.com/music/3music31.shtml), which is both
entertaining and good advice.

We also attended the [Aegis Consulting](http://www.aegisconsulting.org/)
self defense class with Sal Sanfratello. Garrett had mentioned him, but
it didn't prepare me for meeting him. He is a force of nature unto
himself. The class itself was awesome and I lost my voice yelling. We're
thinking about going to their swordcamp later this year.

Sal was nice enough to invite us to his house for a good old fashion
cookout with a bunch of others, including Howard Tayler (who was way
tired), Rob Landley and his new wife Fade,
[Eric](http://www.catb.org/~esr/) and Cathy Raymond, Tracy Worcester,
and some others who I need to get their info again so I can track them
down again next year (or sooner).

Unfortunately, the mosquitoes loved me and I'm still itching from them.
But it didn't ruin the evening. It didn't stop me, Garrett and some
others from firing of a bunch of interesting firearms that Sal had on
hand. He had a firing range set up in his back yard and Garrett was the
range master. Sal made some delicious Cajun fish which was excellent and
I roasted marshmallows. It's been a while since I roasted marshmallows.

It was fun, and tiring. Now that I had a few days to recover, I need to
find out about the Pittsburgh
[Comicon](http://www.pittsburghcomicon.com/) this weekend…

Ciao!
