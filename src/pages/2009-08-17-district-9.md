I saw District 9 last night and it was spectacular. I'm not sure what I
can say about it without ruining the movie. Let me think... uh. Its
sci-fi, but mainly a human drama. It has comedy and action, but it is
ultimately a story about humans being inhuman and humane.

The special effects and visuals are flawless. So much so that you forget
they are even there as you become immersed in the story.

But the story is the best and main part.

I recommend you go see it. Soon. Before everyone on the internet blabs
about it.

Ciao!
