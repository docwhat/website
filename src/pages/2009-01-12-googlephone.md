Robin and I both got Google phones while in New York over the holidays.  She bought a <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/">G1</a> and I ordered the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/dev-devices.html">ADP1</a>.

I've been working my way through "<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/eband/hello-android">Hello, Android</a>" by Ed Burnette.  So far it's been decent.  You can get  <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=704">30% off (till 2009/1/31)</a> using a special code.  I bought the PDF and paper book for less than Barnes and Nobels is selling it down the street.  Good deal, I think.



The hardest part is that so much is alien.  I only ever coded for the Palm (version 2 and 3).  The life cycle is no problem; it makes perfect sense.  But things like Java and Eclipse...well, I've never used them before.

Ciao!
