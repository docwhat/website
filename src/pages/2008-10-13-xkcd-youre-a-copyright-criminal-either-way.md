The always witting and intelligent web comic XKCD makes an excellent point today:

[![XKCD 488: Steal this Comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/steal_this_comic.png)](https://xkcd.com/488/)

Of course, it's a false dichotomy for most people; they don't think
about it this way. For an example of this in the real world consider
those that bought [Walmart's DRM
music](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/26/walmart-shutting-dow.html).
Their choices are either violate the
[DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act)
(which is still illegal even with Walmart's blessing and a waste of time
and quality) or lose their music.
