[David Byrne](http://www.davidbyrne.com/ "David Byrne's homepage") and
[Brian Eno](http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/ "Brian Eno's homepage")
have
[released a new album](http://everythingthathappens.com/ 'Everything That Happens Will Happen Today')
and I'm on my second listen.<!-- more -->

I love the instant gratification of this.  You can buy the CD and you get the
MP3s now and you'll get the CD later in the mail.  Wow. Cool.

In case you're wondering where you've heard of them...

David Byrne was part of the band Talking Heads.  He had a solo career as well.
His voice is pretty distinct. You can find tons of his stuff on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+byrne+video&search_type=&aq=-1&oq=david+byrne+vide).

Brian Eno is an innovative producer and musician.  I think of him like a spice;
you add him to something that is okay to make it really tasty.

Ciao!
