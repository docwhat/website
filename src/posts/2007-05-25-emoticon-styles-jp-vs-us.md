title: 'Emoticon Styles (JP vs. US)'
---

I found this interesting article about
[Americans and Japanese read faces differently](http://www.livescience.com/health/070510_facial_culture.html).
To cut the article short, they explain that Japanese culture seems to read the
eyes for emotional cues while American culture seems to read the mouth.

Quick comparison of [emoticons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons):

|  US | JP         |
| --- | ---------- |
| :-) | ^\_^       |
| x-) | &gt;\_&lt; |
| :-( | ;\_;       |

Interesting. I like the JP emoticons sometimes. This is my favorite:
`\^_^/ yay!`.

Ciao!
