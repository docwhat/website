[![The Selfish
Gene](https://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0199291152.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0199291152%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0199291152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02)
Read this book!

For those unfamiliar with [Scott
Adams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/) and his comic
strip, [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com/), this rant won't be
interesting. The only thing you should take away from this is that
evolution is *not* bullshit and that you should read [The Selfish
Gene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0199291152%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0199291152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02)
by [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/home).

Scott Adams, it turns out, is pretty darn smart. He reads stuff. He
thinks about stuff. However, it doesn't mean he isn't wrong. He wrote a
rant "[Fossils are
bullshit](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/03/fossils_are_bul.html)"
on his [Dilbert Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/)
where he reads a Newsweek article on msnbc and then declares that his
bullshit detector thinks evolution and the fossil record is bullshit.

Let's first off give Mr. Adams credit for even thinking about this. A
bunch of people in the word just read Newsweek and don't really think
about what it says or talk about it anything. Kudos. It's good to think.

It should also be mentioned that the Newsweek article is full of
"evolution revolution" claptrap. How that didn't set his bullshit
detector off, I don't know. If there was a revolution, it'd be a big
deal and in more than just one article in Newsweek and it'd not be
obvious it was a revolution until after it had hit at least a few other
sources.

Back to Mr. Adams: It is possible that one person might know more than
many scientists who study a specific thing. It happens every so often,
but it isn't likely and it is the responsibility of the person making
the claims to provide some proof. If Mr. Adams has some proof to back up
his claims that evolution is bullshit, then he should definitely provide
some proof. But I suspect the real problem is that he doesn't understand
what evolution claims.

More can be said on this, but [PZ
Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers), an evolutionary
developmental biologist and rather famous skeptic, does a better job
than I could in his blog post "[Scott Adams reads Newsweek.
Uh-oh.](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/17/scott-adams-reads-newsweek-uho/)".

The most important thing though is this: read [The Selfish
Gene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0199291152%26tag=thedocwha-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0199291152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02)
by [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/home). It is an exciting
read. It is written clearly. And you'll like it, I promise! It explains
what evolution really is. The stuff you learned in high school (if you
remember it) probably didn't explain it well enough. This will. You will
come away looking at the world going, "Gosh! This is amazing!" … and it
is!

Seriously. Read it.

Ciao!
