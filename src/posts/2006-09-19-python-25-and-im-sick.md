So, I woke up this morning and felt like crap but thought I could make it to
work. Got on the bus and after riding it a stop, I knew that this wasn't going
to work. I got off and schlepped back home.

I did get a bunch of work done; I had to set up an environment at home that I
could do my work on [SQLPAS](http://plone.org/products/sqlpasplugin). I'm
working on the
[docwhat-sessions branch](http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PASPlugins/SQLPASPlugin/branches/docwhat-sessions/)
to finish the group and auth-session support for it so we can use it at work.

While I'm waiting for a quarter gig of data to download, I read that
[Python 2.5](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/) is out.

\*sigh\*

I had to download it and play with it.

I'll post more later with some better descriptions of how it might actually
affect _me_.

If you're interested, I can describe the interesting things I have been coughing
up... No? Later maybe. :-)

Ciao!

**EDIT**: I see that Andrew Kuchling has done a better job than I would have
done with his
[What's New in Python 2.5](http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/whatsnew25.html).
