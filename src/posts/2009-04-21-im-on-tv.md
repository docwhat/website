I'm on TV at KDKA; They did a report on immigration in Pittsburgh and I was one
of the backdrops used for the voice over.  You can see my desk as the reporter
talks to [Raul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valdesperez) and he walks past the
stairs at about 2:47.  And again you can see me up close and scary at 2:55.

It's really my fault since I asked the cameraman about his camera.  I thought
that with all the cool new technology out that the camera would be smaller than
it was. It looked just like the ones I saw 10-20 years ago.  He said that there
was an advantage to it being large: longer battery life and more stability.

The footage was taken about 4 weeks ago, if I remember correctly.

Ciao!

UPDATE: Unfortunately, the video is gone. :disappointed:
