title: "My First House!"
---

So, I haven't been blogging much lately. Part of the reason is that Robin and I
have been working on buying a new house.

This is very stressful and scary. We're almost done. We close on November 16th.
I plan on blogging about the people and companies that provide excellent service
during the process. However, I'm waiting till I'm all done.

It's been a pain in a lot of reasons, and scary. I mean a house costs so much
money, it's insane! Sheesh!

Anyway, I have some
[photos](https://flickr.com/photos/docwhat/sets/72157602423731857/) up on flickr
if you want to look at it. It's a lovely 3 story house, detached in Pittsburgh.
It's a nice walk to the grocery store and only a few blocks from work. It's
move-in ready and no work is needed. I'm excited. And nervous.

I'll post more later; I'm off to be nervous.

Ciao!
