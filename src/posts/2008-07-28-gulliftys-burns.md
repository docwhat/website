Aaah!  There was a
[fire at Gullifty's](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=SLr&resnum=0&tab=wn&ie=UTF-8&ncl=1230793040)
early Sunday morning!  I saw the boarded up front door on the way into work this
morning.

Gullifty's is known for it's desserts and Jazz, but I have used it most for good
Bloody Marys and for being open late.

ADDED (2008/08/11): A sign says that it'll reopen Wednesday, August 13th, 2008.
Yay!
