I got me a [Wii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) for Christmas and it is
fun.

I am very impressed by the design of the Wii. The whole channel concept is
cute. The controllers are excellent. The whole feel and ease of setup is
amazing.

My favorite channel is the
[weather channel](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/12/20), it shows a
rain cloud when it rains and makes a rain sound effect. It stays up-to-date
using the [WiiConnect24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiiConnect24) service.
True, it doesn't do much but the fact they spent that much effort on just
weather shows you how nice the rest of the console is.

I'm not sure what I think about the built-in shopping channel though. I can't
see parents giving kids hundreds of dollars worth of
[Wii points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Points) to buy various things
online. Maybe it'll be a good thing, teaching kids the value of money, even if
the money is called points. Unfortunately, the purchased channels are not
transferable. So if this Wii dies (like most of my console have at one point
or another) then I loose all the channels I purchased. On the plus side, my
[Game cube](http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=220) is my original one; it
never died on me.

The [Wiimote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote) is an amazing bit of
engineering. With accelerometers to detect all kinds of motions and an IR
pointing device. It is a good combination of all the different specialty
controllers, like the guns, mice and steering wheels, into one device. My only
fear is that it may not be good at traditional controls. I won't be 100% sure
I like it till I try out something like
[Zelda](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928519.asp).

I love the idea of the
[Mii channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Channels#Mii_Channel) I hope a
lot of games take advantage of it. You design a character or avatar for
yourself and then use it in things like
[Wii Sports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports) (the default package in
the US) and [Wii Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Play) (the default
package outside the US).

I got to play with some
[friends](http://fadethecat.livejournal.com/1267392.html) yesterday and had a
blast. I can really see the potential for party fun with this console. I just
need two more remotes or for Fade to get a Wii with two remotes of her own.
:-)

I've got the following games:

[Rayman Raving Rabbids](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932877.asp) an
insane romp involving rabbit abuse in what is essentially a large collection
of mini-games.

[Elebits](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/933005.asp) is a quirky
Japanese style game, similar to
[Chibi-Robo](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/583171.asp).

It seems likely we'll get
[Super Swing Golf](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932128.asp), as
Robin is really enjoying the Wii Sports Golf game. I know I'll get
[Zelda](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928519.asp) at some point, but
I have to finish up my
[current RPG](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/459841.asp) first.
[Wii Play](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/935589.asp) is on the list,
in part because I can get another Wiimote with it. As a fan of the WarioWare
titles, I will get
[Smooth Moves](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932946.asp) when it
comes out.

Ooh, so many games, so little time.

Ciao!
