Yeah, I bought [SimCity DS](http://amzn.to/2pjH5CY) and found that it had an
unlock code for the Washington Monument (a GameStop Exclusive!).

I figured that there were more and searched the web. I found
[a list](http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/code/935403.html), but it was
missing one of the monuments (#12). Being the kind of person who can't stand a
missing bit of information, I went looking. I finally found it, but it took
some work because none of the lists had the number next to them. So I compiled
a complete list to share with anyone else who gets SimCity DS.
