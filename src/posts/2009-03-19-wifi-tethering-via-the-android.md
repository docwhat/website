title: Wifi Tethering via the Android
---

**Warning**: This article is very out of date and no longer applies.

In my post "[How to beat the iPhone](../how-to-beat-the-iphone)" I mentioned
that an ideal device would be a portable wifi hotspot.

Well, now one exists for the G1:
[android-wifi-tether project](http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/).

Combined with my giant 2600mAh battery upgrade, my ADP1 can serve wifi to my
iPod Touch and laptop anyplace I can get a data connection.

Too bad Pittsburgh doesn't have T-Mobile 3g yet.

If you have a G1, just scan the QR Code image to the right with the barcode
scanner and it'll take you right to the project so you can install it.  You
need a G1 with root access.

Ciao!
