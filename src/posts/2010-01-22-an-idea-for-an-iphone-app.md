Robin (my awesome wife) came up with an idea for an iPhone app.

We were watching [UHF](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/) and
there is a bit where a guy is trying to
[teach poodles to fly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kFGxH4wrs4)...
by throwing them out the 3rd floor window. There was a pile poodles
on the lawn of his apartment building.

She cracked up.

After she recovered and picked herself off the floor, she said that
I should make a "Teach Poodles to Fly" app. I haven't written an
iPhone app yet, but you know...it almost sounds like fun.

You would use the flick motion to launch poodles out a window. If
you miss, the poodle hits the wall instead of going out the window.
Of course, it's probably not a happy thing for the poodle, either
way.

Ciao!
