I've been on vacation in Bar Harbor, Maine and have enlarged my portable toy
collection somewhat. I usually carry a knife with me at all times, plus I
usually have a multi-tool at hand someplace nearby (bag, backpack, etc.)

I used to carry around a Leatherman (AKA the Pocket Survival Tool) but I
eventually stopped. One reason is because it would become too easy or too hard
to open and shut. The version I have (not all do) has knobs for changing the
tightness but I could never get it to be the right firmness for opening. I
wanted it hard enough to open that it doesn't flop open randomly if I put it
down or drop it in a pocket but easy enough to open that I don't have drop
everything and use both hands to open or shut it. Or worse, needing so much
force to open and shut that it became a hazard.

In addition, it had <em>no</em> locks for the blades. I scared myself silly a
bunch of times trying to use the knife and it would lurch half shut.
Fortunately, the other half of the handle prevented it from shutting
completely and I didn't have anything valuable in the way. The Leatherman was
an attractive idea, but a lousy product. I've long since stopped carrying it.

Now <a href="http://www.swissarmy.com/">Victorinox</a> has the awesome
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNIL8K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000FNIL8K">SwissTool
Spirit Plus Ratchet</a>, which is what the Leatherman should have been to
begin with. It has locks for the blades and other tools. You don't have to
open the pliers to get at the tools. And it has a detent for the blades so
they don't flop open and once they are open, they move easily. I can open most
(not all) of the tools with one hand and shut them too (though I can't do that
fast).

The kit I got, the "plus" model with ratchet, has a small ratchet socket
wrench with it and some bits. As I work on computers all the time, this is
awesome. I also have a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZJ42W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004OZJ42W">Cybertool
34</a> but I can rarely use the socket wrench because it won't fit inside any
computers I use. And using it on the outside is a pain because you have to
twist the tool around even though it's lopsided.

I heartily recommend this tool. It's pretty darn nice.

I also got a new pocket knife. The
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZJ42W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004OZJ42W">Tanto
Blade BK-1</a> from <a href="http://www.benchmade.com/">Benchmade</a>. This is
an excellent knife and I think it's my new favorite. The blade is amazingly
sharp and I like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tant%C5%8D">Tantō</a>-style. The pocket
clip is on the correct (in my opinion) side so that the tip opens down. The
lock the "AXIS" lock and is excellent. It is a spring locked slide on the back
of the knife.

My old favorite knife is a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EHIY6U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B001EHIY6U">Kershaw
Leek 1660cktx</a>. I switched the clip on it (again so the blade opens down)
and carried it for a couple years, but last month the safety broke off when I
dropped it. I have the phone number to Kershaw and I've been told that I just
have to call to get a replacement part. My wife has one too and her safety
broke as well. Other than that, I do like them. Though the 1660 is a little
shorter in my hand than I'd like.

Finally, we bought a pair of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076QVPU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B00076QVPU">Pentax
8x40 PCF WP II Binoculars</a> because we forgot our el-cheapo pair at home (we
used to carry them in the car all the time, but apparently we didn't move them
into the new car). I'm not a binoculars nuts, so I'm not very qualified, but
they seem very nice. Good field of view, easy controls, and they are
waterproof to 1meter. I've seen binoculars gets messed up by moisture, so I
thought this was a great idea. We used them to watch lounging seals and flying
birds.

I bought my new toys at "Jekyll & Hyde" in Bar Harbor, Maine. The gentleman
who helped me was knowledgable and was willing to let me drool my way through
his whole stock (I'm only <em>admitting</em> to doing that once). And the
prices are were actually as good or better than Amazon, which I thought was
great.
