For all those cell phone companies trying to figure out how to beat AT&T's
stranglehold on the [iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone); here's a
strategy that will let you go past it.

Create a new phone.  It should be simple.  It should include only a contact
list, SMS, and voice mail.  It should not include calendars, mp3 players, or
anything else.  It should be sleek, simple and stylish.

It should have one other feature: it should be able to act as a very short
range WAP using wifi, bluetooth, or usb.

Why?

Because then a person can buy an
[iPod Touch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_touch) or any other wifi,
bluetooth, or usb networkable device and use _your service_.  Notice that the
same phone can be used to connect a laptop, a netbook, a PDA, or anything
else.

Ciao!
