_[Rob Landley](http://landley.net/) has an awesomely well written reminder of
why we should all vote today.  He's given me permission to post the whole this
here. Any formatting errors are mine._

The existence of
[a Google Maps polling place finder](http://maps.google.com/maps/mpl?moduleurl=http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/mapplets/elections/2008/us-voter-info/us-voter-info.xml)
is pretty darn cool, if you ask me.

I really really really hope that
[Bush Fatigue](http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/04/bush-sr-bush-fatigue-may-be-setting-in.html)
actually has motivated people to the 90% voter turnout they're expecting in
some places. I know that when Sarah Palin complains that her first amendment
rights are being infringed upon by other people's criticism of what she
says... that kind of Complete Failure To Get It is just not noteworthy
anymore. We've had eight years of
[Refuge in Audacity](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity).
We forget about old scandals because they're constantly buried by new
scandals.

Outing Valerie Plame for political gain was <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">treason</span>, a crime they execute
people for, and enough of her contacts got killed after she was outed to
justify doing so as manslaughter anyway. The whole Alberto Gonzales thing
wasn't related to that, nor was the brouhaha about waterboarding, which this
administration did <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> Abu Ghraib caused such an
international scandal; how tone deaf can you <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span>? I'm still mad at Obama about
FISA, but he wasn't the guy who demanded the warantless wiretapping in the
first place. And that's all just <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">recent</span> stuff, the no-bid contracts
for Haliburton are mere embezzlement and having oil lobbyists draft your first
energy policy seems like a rounding error in comparison, but coming up with
<span
style="text-decoration: underline;">bigger</span> scandals to distract from
the existing ones should not be a successful survival strategy for 8
consecutive years.

These idiots never finish <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">anything</span>. Iraq didn't mean
Afghanistan was over. The cleanup from Katrina is ongoing; did Hurricane
Andrew in Florida back in the 90's still have this kind of lingering damage 3
years later? This banking thing isn't even our first massive economic crisis
on this moron's watch; doesn't anybody even remember Worldcom or Enron
anymore? (California brownouts? Anyone?) Anybody remember Treasury secretary
[Paul O'Neil resigning](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2551389.stm)
back in 2002 and becoming the first in a long line of ex-insiders publicly
lambasting the administration for malignant incompetence, and being
[proven right](http://crooksandliars.com/taxonomy/term/1598)?

McCain abandoned his principles during the primary to court the "base" of
right-wing religious extremists, and got himself stuck there somehow. (It's
like he's a horror movie where he's a hostage, and Palin's his keeper or
something.) There's a guy with an actual brain hidden under that campaign,
which you can see in old Daily Show appearances, or the speech he gave at that
roast thingy a couple weeks back, or his recent Saturday Night Live
appearance. Not great, but not run-away-screaming creepy like the guy we've
seen campaigning this year. But no matter who McCain himself is, his campaign
brings with it the same group of cronies that the first two Bush
administrations had, Karl Rove's progeny. And if McCain's a doormat to them
all through the campaign, he'd be a doormat to them in office too.

The definition of insanity is endlessly repeating the same actions and
expecting different results. The fact that there are still over a dozen states
solidly voting for McCain, and <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> chance he might still win,
implies that this country has some seriously hard-core idiots. I mean really.
I'm boggling. HOW CAN YOU NOT GET IT? After the past 8 years, what does it
take to convince you that there is some seriously bad juju at the heart of the
current republican party? Whether or not you agree with the ideals
intermittently (and conflictingly) espoused, that the implementation is an
unmitigated disaster should be obvious to small children, pets, even some of
your more active house plants by now.

They're "conservative", right. What exactly are they conserving? It's
obviously not money, our national debt is now over \$10 trillion, and the
deficit's never been higher (even at the height of the cold war). They're not
conserving energy, or water, or any other environmental thing. So what is it
then?

(Speaking of money, the whole "tax cuts for the wealthy" thing is rationalized
because we can't punish hard-earned success. Didn't John McCain marry a rich
wife rather than earning his own millions, and didn't she inherit her money?
And these are the spokesbeings put forth to promote this philosophy?)

They're "socially conservative", they believe new social developments are
immoral and to counter it the government should control public morals.
Legislate morality. And they do so while crying for less government and
wiretapping us without a warrant. Send people to the other side of the planet
so women can't be forced to wear Burkas, then impose crippling FCC fines when
a clearly accidental "wardrobe malfunction" happens at a superbowl halftime
for under a second. Federal regulations should specify how long miniskirt
lengths can be, with inspectors? (And of course people can't have sex out of
wedlock but if they want to get married you throw Proposition 8 at them, but
that's state level lunacy.)

And they keep getting <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">indicted</span>. The moral crusaders are
the people caught having covert homosexual relations with pages or random
strangers in airport bathrooms. John McCain keeps going on about this Ayers
guy when McCain was a member of the Keating 5. They scream about Acorn but
live with Diebold. McCain is of course on his
[second marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain#Commanding_officer.2C_liaison_to_Senate.2C_and_second_marriage)
(having divorced his first wife to marry a younger rich blond woman), just
like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich before him. (Remember the big "Family Values"
campaign in 1996, the last election pre-Bush jr?) If you take them at their
word and judge them by their own standards, that's when they fail worst of
all.

As far as I can tell, rather a lot of religious nuts either fervently avoid
thinking (because God works in mysterious ways so it never has to make sense)
or are actively trying to hasten The Rapture. They believe God is omniscient
and all-powerful and therefore it's vital they take action to micromanage the
world around them or else it'll all fall apart. The hypocrisy is built-in at
every level.

I'm starting to believe that
[Sturgeon's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) applies to the
population at large. Alas, I believe most of the Republican party would agree
with me, which is a strong counter-argument. But it's clear there are
determined, dedicated, self-destructive idiots out there who want to take the
rest of us with them. And not all of 'em are on Zoloft.

The only way the system has <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span> worked is if the rest of us
work even harder to counter them.

To quote John Adams in the marvelous movie
[1776](http://www.amazon.com/1776-Restored-Directors-William-Daniels/dp/B000067D1R),
"Now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vote</span>, damn you."
