[![The ferrets in
question.](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4505256023_54fa1fd30d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/docwhat/4505256023/)

We just got our selves a pair of ferrets. Yay! And boy are they cute and
energetic.

You can identify which is which by their foreheads. One (the alpha) has a
white forehead. The other has a pair of dark marks on her head.

Both are female.

They still need to settle into our household. Though the dark mark one did her
happy dance this morning (its hard to describe, but great fun).

The other, the alpha, is apparently a hand biter. Since she bites when nothing
is going on, I suspect she is either still stressed out or has bad
associations with hands. They were cage ferrets and have never had owners, so
we have a little work ahead making them comfortable with people.

Check out the

give us some suggestions for names!

\[**update 2010-04-12:** They have been named! The alpha is _Fang_ and the
non-alpha is _Pepper_.\]

Ciao!

P.S.: Man, are these things hard to photograph. They don't sit still for a
moment. Pure energy. I'm sure as they get more used to us, we will get better
photos.
